# Enhanced iFrame Protection - Browser Extension

Enhanced iFrame Protection (EIP) is a lightweight extension to automatically detect and provide verbose warnings for embedded iframe elements in order to protect against Browser-In-The-Browser (BITB) attacks.

# Screenshots

In the above screenshot, a phishing website has embedded an iframe element within a div that has been styled to look like an actual browser window (with a fake URL bar claiming to be from *accounts.google.com*). 

This extension has detected the iframe and presented a security warning, highlighting the actual phishing domain (*bigphish.ca*).
